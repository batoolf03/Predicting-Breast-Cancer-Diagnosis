Used classification techniques such as decision tree, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors that predicts the diagnose result based on ten real-valued features(mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest of these features). I attempted to explore model performance for each algorithm for several different parameter values, and provide the best predictive performance.

I considered confusion matrix, predictive accuracy, classification error, precision, recall, f-measure to evaluate model 'goodness' for each predictive modeling process.
